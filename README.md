# Marián Čekovský – motivational chat

When I created at the age of 16 music video about "[Life with ISIC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07TXVp8rjss)", I had the opportunity to talk with the famous Slovak musician, singer, songwriter, comedian and presenter Marián Čekovský.

I remember how my father mentioned that he positively enjoyed the music video. After the award ceremony, we met, and he said,

**`Great job! Keep going!`**

Hearing this honest sentence from him motivated me to continue on my filmmaking path.
